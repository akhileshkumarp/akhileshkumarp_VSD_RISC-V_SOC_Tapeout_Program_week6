# Sky130 Day 2 - Good floorplan vs bad floorplan and introduction to library cells

#Chip Floor planning considerations
> Utilization factor and aspect ratio
> Concept of pre-placed cells
> De-coupling capacitors
> Power planning
> Pin placement and logical cell placement blockage
> Steps to run floorplan using OpenLANE
> Review floorplan files and steps to view floorplan
> Review floorplan layout in Magic

#Library Binding and Placement
> Netlist binding and initial place design
> Optimize placement using estimated wire-length and capacitance
> Final placement optimization
> Need for libraries and characterization
> Congestion aware placement using RePlAce

#Cell design and characterization flows
> Inputs for cell design flow
> Circuit design step
> Layout design step
> Typical characterization flow

#General timing characterization parameters
> Timing threshold definitions
> Propagation delay and transition time
